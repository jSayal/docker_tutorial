# Container Images

## What is an Image?
Image consists of application binaries and dependencies and metadata about the image data and how to run the image.

Official definition is not very interesting, so ignore it for now.

Image does not contain a complete OS, no kernel or kernel modules (drivers), all these things are provided by the host machine.

## Using Dockerhub
Docker hub is a repository of docker images, some are official e.g nginx publishes an official image and other developers can make changes to official images or create their own and publish on dockerhub. It's like github but for docker images.

For non-official images, pulls and stars can be used to find good images. The most obvious way to tell the difference b/w official and non-official images is that official images will have no username attached to it. For example for nginx -> official image has a name nginx but for non-official images, its username/nginx-something.

## Image tags
Docker images do not have versions, but it uses tags that defines sort of like versions. An image can have more than one tag that refer to same image. 

For example in case of nginx, ```1.15.0, mainline, 1, 1.15, latest``` all these tags refer to the same image. latest tag means that you are always pulling the latest image of docker hub, but does not necessarily means it has the most upto date code base. Also latest is default tag, if we do not specify any tag.

```bash
$ docker pull nginx        # it will pull the latest image
$ docker pull nginx:1.15.0 # In this case, it will pull the same image, but tag is different

# For similar tags, Docker will not pull images, if the download tag refer to already downloaded
# image.
```

**NOTE: alpine images are always smaller.**

## Images and their Layers
This is a fundamental concpet about how Docker works. It uses union file system, that is bascially a history of changes of files to create an actual file system.

To find out layers of an image, we can use a history command
```go
$ docker history nginx

# All the layers of nginx image. Some layers only add, metadata and they do not have any
# effect of file size.
# ------
# Docker gives a unique sha to each layer, and reuse it, whenever it can. This applies to both
# uploading and downloading images.

```

To get metadata about an image, we can use ```inspect``` command. Most common metadata is exposed ports, environment variables, how to run the image etc.
```bash
$ docker inspect nginx      # Detailed ouput divied into sections. Better see it yourself.
```
