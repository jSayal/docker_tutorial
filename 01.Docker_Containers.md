# Creating and Using a Container

## Installing docker 
For Mac OSX and Windown just download the installer. For Linux google instructions for your particular distro.

## Checkout docker install and config
```bash
# To check installation of docker run, it will give information 
# about Client and Server and which docker version you are running
$ docker version 

## This commands tells us lots of details about docker including how
## many contianers we have running, paused and stopped and a whole
## lot more that we will discuss later
$ docker info
```

## Image vs Container
- An image is an application that we wanted to run.
- Container is an instance of that image running as process
- You can have many container running of the same image
- In this section we will be using Nginx web server
- Docker's default image registery is called [Dokcer Hub](https://hub.docker.com)

**Installing and running a nginx container**

```bash
## This command will ask the docker to run nginx container,
## docker will look for already download containers of nginx and
## if not found it will download the latest nginx image from Docker
## Hub and run it.
## PORT MAPPING - 80:80 first port is for local machine and second
## port is for docker image.
## PUBLISH - opens a port on docker container, if we do not specify
## any port, it will not open any port.
$ docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx

# To give a name to container
$ docker container run --publish 80:80 --name webhost nginx

## To run container in background, once container starts running 
## docker will give us a unique id for this container.
$ docker container run -publush 80:80 --detach nginx
```

To get list of running containers
```bash
$ docker container ls      # shows all running containers
$ docker container ls -a  # shows all container running or not
```

To stop a running container
```bash
$ docker container stop <first new characters/digits> of continer id>
```

To get logs for container running in background
```go
$ docker container logs <container_name>
```

To check on running continaer
```bash
## Shows list of running processes in the container
$ docker container top <container_name>
```

To remove container(s)
```bash
$ docker container rm <id> <id> <id> # remove all containers listed

# Above command will not remove any running containers
# To forefully remove containers use the following command.
# It will remove container even if its running
$ docker container rm -f <id>
```

## What happens in docker 'container run'
Looks for image in image cache, if an image is found docker will run it and if none is found it will download it from Docker Hub. If we do not specify any version of image as in our case nginx, it will download the latest version. We can specify image version by using ```ngnix:<version>```. 
Once image is downloaded, it will create a new container based on that image and prepares to start. Docker has virtual network, and for any container it creates it will give that container a virutal IP address in its virtual network. With ```--publish``` flag we ask docker to open ports on container to map those ports to local machine ports.
Lastly, it will start container by using ```CMD``` in the image ```Dockerfile```.

## Container Vs VM
Containers are not VM. Container is just a process running on host machine. Docker for Max/Windows a tiny linux distro runs to simulate linux environment, but it is still just a process. To read more about the differences refer to ebook ```Docker_eBook_Jan_2017.pdf``` in the root directory.

## Practice running, stopping and removing containers
- Run three containers mysql, nginx and httpd(apache)
- Stop all three containers
- Remove al three containers
```bash
# Starting three containers
$ docker container run -d -p 3306:3306 --name db -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes mysql
$ docker container run -d -p 8080:80 --name webserver httpd
$ docker container run -d -p 80:80 --name proxy nginx

# To get root password for mysql
$ docker container logs db # password should be in logs

# Check if apache and nginx is running
$ curl localhost:80     # ngnix
$ curl localhost:8080   # apache

# Stopping three containers
$ docker container stop db webserver proxy

# Removing three containers
$ docker container rm db webserver proxy

# Check if all containers are removed
$ docker process ls -a
```

## What's going on in containers
There are many commands that you can use to find out what is happening inside a container, some of them are follows

```bash
$ docker container top      # process list in container (single container)
$ docker container inspect  # details of container config (single container)
$ docker container stats    # performance stats for all containers
```

## Getting a shell inside a container
```bash
# bash argument at the end will open bash shell to container
# If -d or --detach arg is used no shell will be opened
$ docker container run -it -p 8888:80 --name webhost nginx bash

# When container will start you will have the bash shell open for the container
root@ac8250426a3c:/# <you can type any commands here>
root@ac8250426a3c:/# exit # to exit shell

# Exiting from shell will also stop the container

# To re-start this container
$ docker container start -ai webhost # you will see the shell again
```
In addition to using ```-it``` flags we can also use --exec flag. Using this, we do not have to keep the bash shell open as it was the case with ```-it``` command.

```bash
$ docker container run -d -p 8888:80 --name webhost nginx

# To acess bash shell
$ docker container exec -it webhost bash # will run bash on container
```

## Pulling images from Docker Hub
```bash
# Pull alpine linux image 
$ docker pull alpine # a very small distro of linux about 5MB 

# Run alpine linux container
# Alpine linux do not have bash so we have to run sh
$ docker container start alpine sh # somehow it is not running without sh arg

# Alpine linux is a tiny linux distro that is focused on security.
```
Following article will show basic commands related to different linux package managers.

## Docker network concepts

When we create a container, we are in background connecting to a particular docker network and by default it is the bridge network. All Docker networks are virtual networks and they route through NAT firewall on host IP. Docker daemon configure the host's IP address on its interface, so that container can get access to internet.

We dont need to configure -p flag when containers want to commnunicate to each other on a virtual network.

With Docker, most of the settings are configurable.
- We can create new virtual networks
- Attach containers to multiple or no networks
- Skip virtual network and use host IP (--net=host), this option skips most of the benefits of docker security, but can be desireable under special circumstances.
- User Docker network drivers to gain new abilities.

If a Docker container do not expose any ports, no outside process can access it, only other
containers in the same virtual networks can commnunicate with that container.

Docker container do not use the same IP as host unless set otherwise. 

To get IP of a container
```bash
$ docker container inspect --format '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' <container-name>

# Docker uses Go format which you can use to manipulate the output format of certain 
# commands and log drivers. 
# Docker provides a set of basic functions to manipulate template elements. All of these 
# examples use the docker inspect command, but many other CLI commands have a --format 
# flag, and many of the 
# CLI command references include examples of customizing the output format
# https://docs.docker.com/config/formatting/#join
```

### Commands relating to Docker networks
Get port of a docker container
```bash
$ docker container port <container_name>

# Output
# 80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:8888
```

Get list of all docker networks
```bash
$ docker network ls
# bridge is default network by default for all container if not specified otherwise
```

Inspeact a network
```bash
$ docker network inspect <network-name> # use bridge if you have not created any new networks
```

Create a Docker network
```bash
$ docker network create <new-network-name>
# --driver flag can be used to specify a different driver (3rd party drivers) default is bridge
```

Connecting and disconnecting from a network
```bash
$ docker network connect
$ docker network disconnect
```

We can connect one container to multiple docker networks
```bash
$ docker network create my_app_net
# id for this new network is f9f2e4978770

# There is already a container named webhost running on bridge network, if want to 
# connect webhost to my_app_net, we can use the network connect command

$ docker network connect f9f2e4978770 webhost
# Now webhost will be connected to two docker virtual networks, and we can verify by the 
# container inspect command.

$ docker container inspect webhost

# -- portion of network inspect command

#     "bridge": {
#         "IPAMConfig": null,

#         "Aliases": [
#             "80c6671b9223"
#         ],

#         "GlobalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
#         "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:03",
#         "DriverOpts": null
#     }
# }
```

Disconnecting a container from docker network
```bash
$ docker network disconnect f9f2e4978770 webhost
# Now webhost container is no longer connected to my_app_net
```

### Docker Networks: DNS
For Docker networks we cannot rely on container's IP address, as containers can be created and destroyed on need basis. To overcome this, Docker has its own DNS system that identifies container by its name (therefore it is also a good practice to name your containers). In Docker, container name is equals to hostname for containers talking to each other.

```bash
# First create a new network
$ docket network create my_app_net

# Pull nginx:alpine image
$ docker pull nginx:alpine

# Run two containers on my_app_net
$ docker run container -d --name webhost1 --network my_app_net nginx:alpine
$ docker run container -d --name webhost2 --network my_app_net nginx:alpine

# Check that containers are running 
$ docker container ls

# You can also check by inspecting network that it has two containers named webhost1 & 
# webhost2
$ docker network inspect my_app_net

# We have not exposed any port from the webhost1 & webhost2 container, but they can 
# communicate with each other 
$ docker container exec -it webhost1 ping webhost2
$ docker container exec -it webhost2 ping webhost1

# Here webhost2 and webhost1 are being used as domain names as Docker provides an 
# internal DNS system for networks that we create.

# Default bridge network does not have this automatic DNS system, but we can use --link 
# flag to create manual links b/w containers. It's much easier to work with creating a 
# new network.


    # -- Response --
    # 64 bytes from 172.18.0.4: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.083 ms
    # 64 bytes from 172.18.0.4: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.130 ms
    # 64 bytes from 172.18.0.4: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.129 ms

```

## Assigning aliases to containers
We can assign aliases to containers using ```--net-alias <alias-name>``` flag and docker network will do round robin load balancing on these containers.

```bash
# Create a new network
$ docker create network test_net

# Run two elasticsearch containers with alias of 'search' on test_net
$ docker container run -d --network test_net --net-alias search elasticsearch:2
$ docker container run -d --network test_net --net-alias search elasticsearch:2

# Run centOS distro with curl command to verify alias
$ docker container run -rm --network test_net centos curl -s search:9200
$ docker container run -rm --network test_net centos curl -s search:9200
$ docker container run -rm --network test_net centos curl -s search:9200
$ docker container run -rm --network test_net centos curl -s search:9200

# -rm is automatic clean up
# As we run curl command, one of the two elasticsearch servers will respond, sometimes 
# two in in a row and sometimes one after other.
```
